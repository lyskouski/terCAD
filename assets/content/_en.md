# terCAD - Data Quality Gate Portal for Educational Purpose

> Design the road to your cherished dream

terCAD - Teach, Educate, Research with help of Computer Aid Design. Learn2Learn Toolkit, Learning Management System (LMS), Goal-Setting Motivator, Courses Guiding Aggregator.

Solution is based on next methodologies: Kottler process, ADKAR process, eduScrum, Lean Agile + OKRs, and Quantum Cognitive Science; and toolkits: Graph based courses, Mnemonics, Kanban, Roadmap, Powerful Questions (ML/AI).


## Problem (why now)

COVID-19 isolation years have reopened investments into alternative learning processes and researches about their effectiveness.

> “Quantum Cognitive Science can break the vicious circle between reductionism and dualism… intelligence requires understanding, and understanding requires awareness” Sir Roger Penrose (Nobel Prize 2020 in Physics)

> “There is so much information like it isn’t any” Tatyana Chernigovskaya (neuroscientist)

Enormous variety of different courses, resources and materials leads to a distraction and losing of any motivation to change the status “quo”. Digital hygiene with additional mentoring from outside can be a solution. So, terCAD, as a new product, is “Meat Grinder” for already existing courses.


## Solution ( to tackle the market )

**User Experience** is based on an initial question “Whom do I want to be?”

Based on the answer our platform is preparing Roadmap to reach the target based on defined presets and methodists work. Engagement is controlled via Kanban Board and its Metrics, that are used to Facilitate involvements and preserve Motivation.

We’re introducing a technical excellence in a market that’s previously been used by a small business in a category of content “Best teaching courses in 20__ to become a ____”, it has never been touched and/or overheated by Enterprise Solutions.

Everything is a matter of **Quality** and **Speed** of taken **Information** directly for **your Purpose**.


## Benefits

> Water wears stones (proverb)

Infinite flow of our activity independently of its capacity anyway generates a value. It can be growth faster or slower (based on investments) but helps to make A/B testing each week (release) and identify an opportunity with a zero risk of a failure.

On a minefield you have to be the slowest turtle and you'll return back alive, in the business it's mostly likely a hunters treasure who scour the ruins very slowly, and even a small coin can cost millions.


## Solution (why we)

Scientific Research for the course would be a main corner in our StartUp evolution model, at list, that’ll confirm that the deep analysis was preliminary and meticulously done as a pre-step of creation.
